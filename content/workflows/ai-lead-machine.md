## Overview

The AI Lead Machine is a comprehensive workflow that transforms scattered marketing efforts into a systematic lead generation engine. This workflow combines strategic planning with AI-powered execution to create predictable, scalable demand for B2B service businesses.

### What You'll Build

By the end of this workflow, you'll have:

- **Complete ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)** with detailed buyer personas
- **Messaging map** aligned to awareness stages
- **90-day content calendar** with specific topics and angles
- **Lead magnets** designed for each funnel stage
- **Distribution strategy** across LinkedIn, email, and content marketing
- **Tracking system** to measure and optimize performance

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (30 minutes)

#### Step 1: Define Your ICP
Use this prompt to create a detailed ideal customer profile:

```
I run a [TYPE OF BUSINESS] serving [INDUSTRY/SECTOR]. Help me create a detailed ICP.

Include:
- Company size, revenue, geographic location
- Job titles of decision makers and influencers
- Current challenges and pain points they face
- How they currently solve these problems
- Triggers that make them actively search for solutions
- Budget considerations and decision-making process

Make it specific enough that I could recognize my ideal customer in a LinkedIn search.
```

#### Step 2: Map Your Value Proposition
```
Based on this ICP: [INSERT ICP FROM STEP 1]

Create a value proposition map that shows:
- What specific outcomes we deliver
- How we're different from alternatives (doing nothing, DIY, competitors)
- Proof points that support our claims
- Risk mitigation (what happens if they don't act)

Frame everything in terms of business impact, not features.
```

### Phase 2: Content Strategy (45 minutes)

#### Step 3: Create Content Pillars
```
Given my ICP and value prop, create 4 content pillars for my B2B services business.

For each pillar:
- Main theme and key messages
- 10 specific content angles/topics
- Mix of educational, thought leadership, and social proof
- How it connects to our services without being salesy

Ensure content builds authority and moves prospects through awareness → consideration → decision.
```

#### Step 4: Build 90-Day Content Calendar
```
Create a 90-day content calendar using these pillars: [INSERT PILLARS]

Format:
Week 1-4: [Theme focus]
- Monday: [Platform] - [Content type] - [Specific topic]
- Wednesday: [Platform] - [Content type] - [Specific topic]  
- Friday: [Platform] - [Content type] - [Specific topic]

Include:
- Mix of LinkedIn posts, blog articles, email newsletters
- Seasonal/timely content opportunities
- Lead magnet promotion schedule
- Specific CTAs for each piece
```

### Phase 3: Lead Capture System (15 minutes)

#### Step 5: Design Lead Magnets
```
Create 3 lead magnets for different awareness stages:

1. TOFU (Problem Aware): Educational resource
2. MOFU (Solution Aware): Framework/template
3. BOFU (Vendor Aware): Assessment/audit

For each lead magnet:
- Compelling title and subtitle
- Brief description of value
- Outline of contents (if it's a guide/template)
- Landing page copy
- Follow-up email sequence (3-5 emails)

Make them specific to this ICP: [INSERT ICP]
```

## Advanced Variations

### For Agencies/Consultancies
Add this to your prompts:
> "This is for a professional services firm that needs to demonstrate expertise and build trust before prospects will engage."

### For SaaS/Tech Companies  
Add this modifier:
> "Focus on product-led growth principles and include trial/demo opportunities in the funnel."

### For Regulated Industries
Include this constraint:
> "Ensure all messaging complies with [INDUSTRY] regulations and maintains professional, compliant tone."
