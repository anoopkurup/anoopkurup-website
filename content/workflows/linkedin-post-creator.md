## Overview

The LinkedIn Post Creator workflow transforms topic ideas into engaging, authority-building posts that generate meaningful engagement without being salesy. Perfect for consultants, agency founders, and business leaders who want consistent LinkedIn presence.

### What You'll Create

Each use of this workflow produces:

- **Engaging hook** that stops the scroll
- **1-2 valuable insights** that demonstrate expertise  
- **Clear takeaway** readers can implement
- **Soft call-to-action** to build following
- **Optimized formatting** for LinkedIn algorithm

## The Core Workflow

### Step 1: Topic + Angle Selection (3 minutes)
Start with this prompt to brainstorm topics:

```
I'm a [YOUR ROLE] specializing in [YOUR EXPERTISE] for [TARGET AUDIENCE].

Generate 10 LinkedIn post topics that:
- Address real challenges my audience faces
- Showcase my expertise without being promotional
- Can be explained in 200 words or less
- Include contrarian/fresh angles when possible

Format: "Topic: [Topic] | Angle: [Specific perspective]"
```

### Step 2: Post Creation (10 minutes)
Use this main prompt for each post:

```
You are a LinkedIn ghostwriter for a [YOUR ROLE] in [INDUSTRY].

Topic: [CHOSEN TOPIC]
Angle: [SPECIFIC PERSPECTIVE]

Write a 180-220 word LinkedIn post that:

STRUCTURE:
- Hook (1-2 lines that create curiosity/pattern interrupt)
- Context (brief setup of the problem/situation)
- Insight #1 (your main point with specific example)
- Insight #2 (supporting point or contrarian view)
- Takeaway (what they should do next)
- Soft CTA (follow for more insights like this)

STYLE:
- Conversational, not corporate
- Short sentences and paragraphs
- Include one personal story or client example (anonymized)
- No buzzwords or jargon
- End with a question to drive comments

TONE: [Helpful expert | Thoughtful challenger | Strategic advisor]
```

### Step 3: Optimization (2 minutes)
Polish with this follow-up prompt:

```
Review this LinkedIn post and suggest improvements for:

1. Hook strength (does it stop the scroll?)
2. Clarity (can someone skim and get value?)
3. Engagement potential (will people comment?)
4. Authority building (does it showcase expertise?)
5. LinkedIn formatting (line breaks, readability)

Original post: [PASTE YOUR POST]

Provide the optimized version.
```

## Advanced Variations

### For Different Content Types

#### Story-Based Posts
Add this to your main prompt:
> "Frame this as a story about a client situation (anonymized). Use the format: Problem → What most people do → What worked instead → Lesson."

#### Data-Driven Posts  
Include this instruction:
> "Include 2-3 specific statistics or data points. If you don't have real data, suggest what type of metrics would support this point."

#### Contrarian Takes
Add this angle:
> "Take a contrarian position against common industry advice. Structure as: Popular belief → Why it's wrong → Better approach → Results you've seen."

### Industry-Specific Adaptations

#### Professional Services
```
Focus on:
- Process improvements and efficiency
- Client results (anonymized)
- Industry-specific challenges
- Thought leadership on trends

Avoid:
- Direct service promotion
- Generic business advice
- Overly technical jargon
```

#### Tech/SaaS
```
Include:
- Product insights without pitching
- Industry trends and predictions
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Technical concepts made simple
```

## Content Calendar Integration

### Weekly Theme Structure
- **Monday**: Industry insights/trends
- **Wednesday**: Process/framework shares
- **Friday**: Story/case study (anonymized)

### Monthly Content Mix
- 40% Educational (how-to, frameworks)
- 30% Insights (industry observations, predictions)
- 20% Stories (client work, personal experiences)  
- 10% Engagement (questions, polls, controversial takes)

## Engagement Optimization

### Post Timing
Use this prompt to optimize timing:
```
Based on my audience of [TARGET AUDIENCE] in [GEOGRAPHIC REGION], when should I post on LinkedIn for maximum engagement?

Consider:
- Time zones of my primary audience
- When B2B decision makers are most active
- LinkedIn algorithm preferences
- Industry-specific patterns

Provide specific day/time recommendations.
```

### Comment Strategy
Prepare follow-up comments with:
```
For this LinkedIn post: [PASTE POST]

Write 3 thoughtful follow-up comments I can post if the conversation gets going:

1. Additional insight that expands on the main point
2. Question to deepen the discussion
3. Related example or mini-case study

Keep each under 50 words and maintain the conversational tone.
```

## Troubleshooting

### "My posts aren't getting engagement"
