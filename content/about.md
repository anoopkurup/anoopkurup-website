      ## Who I Am
      
      I started my career in research engineering, moved into intellectual property analysis, and then into building businesses of my own. Along the way, I discovered a common problem: most companies—even brilliant ones—struggle with marketing.
      
      Not because they don't try. But because their marketing is scattered, tactical, and disconnected from strategy.
      
      For the past 15+ years, I've been helping businesses fix this. From consulting firms and marketing agencies to training companies and tech-enabled services, my focus has always been on turning marketing into a structured system that supports growth.

      ## How I Work
      
      I combine classic marketing fundamentals (strategy, positioning, customer journey) with AI-driven workflows and automation. This balance ensures businesses aren't just experimenting with the latest trend, but building sustainable systems.

      ## A Personal Note
      
      I'm not interested in quick wins or superficial growth hacks. My work is about clarity and systems—building the kind of marketing that keeps working long after the campaign ends.
      
      When I work with you, I'm hands-on. I'll help you think through positioning, strategy, and execution—but I'll also help you design workflows and use AI tools that make your marketing faster and cheaper.
      
      My goal is simple: marketing that feels less like chaos and more like a system that works for you.
