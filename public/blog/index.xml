      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most professional service businesses approach their offerings like a buffet—throwing everything they can do onto their website and hoping something sticks. They list consulting, training, workshops, implementation, strategy sessions, and audits all on equal footing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result? Confused prospects who can&amp;rsquo;t figure out where to start, lengthy sales cycles where you&amp;rsquo;re explaining your entire service menu, and close rates that depend more on luck than systematic positioning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this pattern across hundreds of engagements. Marketing agencies offering everything from &amp;ldquo;brand strategy&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;social media management.&amp;rdquo; Law firms providing &amp;ldquo;general counsel services&amp;rdquo; alongside &amp;ldquo;specialized IP litigation.&amp;rdquo; Consultants who do &amp;ldquo;strategic planning&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tactical implementation&amp;rdquo; without clear distinctions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do Followers on Social Media Translate Into Future Clients?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We follow people on social media who entertain, educate, inspire, or inform. We follow brands we like, purchase from regular, or aspire to buy products from at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rarely do we follow someone in the services industry, or agencies with the intent of becoming their clients. “I want to buy services from this person, let me follow their social media accounts”, said no one, ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience a vast majority of followers, specially in the services industry, are there to learn from you. They are probably a level below your level of knowledge and understanding. They follow you to get more insights and lessons. Learning from your experience and expertise. As professionals, there are few opportunities to learn new things, and upgrade your knowledge. Following an experienced person in the industry gives them the necessary insights in bite size chunks on various platforms. At least that is the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
