      ## Why Marketing Feels Hard
      
      Most businesses don't fail at marketing because they lack effort. They fail because:
      
      - Their messaging is unclear and doesn't cut through the noise.
      - Their team is busy executing tactics without a unifying strategy.
      - They rely on referrals or one channel, leaving growth unpredictable.
      - They're experimenting with AI tools, but without integration into a system.
      
      The result? Marketing feels like chaos. Leads are inconsistent. Growth feels stuck.
