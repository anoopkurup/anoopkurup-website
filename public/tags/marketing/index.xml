      <title>A LinkedIn Content System That Scales Without Burnout</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I watch successful consultants and agency founders burn out on LinkedIn content creation every month. They start strong, posting daily insights and building genuine engagement. Then the demand for fresh ideas becomes overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They hit the wall at week 3 or 4: staring at the blank LinkedIn composer, feeling like they&amp;rsquo;ve already shared every thought worth sharing. The daily grind of content creation transforms from opportunity into obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t lack of expertise or insights. These are brilliant professionals with decades of experience. The problem is approaching LinkedIn content as a daily creative task instead of designing systematic approaches that compound reach while reducing daily effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From AIDA to AI: Turn Frameworks into Marketing Workflows</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every marketing consultant I know can recite AIDA in their sleep: Attention, Interest, Desire, Action. They know PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solution), StoryBrand frameworks, and Before/After/Bridge structures by heart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet when it comes time to write that sales email, create social media content, or draft website copy, they still stare at blank pages. They know the frameworks but struggle to apply them consistently across dozens of pieces of content each month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The MQL-SQL Handshake: Fixing the Drop-Off</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was reviewing a SaaS company&amp;rsquo;s pipeline data last month when I discovered a shocking statistic: they were losing 67% of their marketing qualified leads before sales ever contacted them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their marketing team was celebrating record MQL numbers while their sales team complained about lead quality. Both sides blamed the other for poor performance, but the real problem was hiding in the handoff process between the two teams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t unique to that company. I see the same pattern across dozens of B2B organizations: sophisticated lead generation systems that fall apart at the critical moment when marketing passes leads to sales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
