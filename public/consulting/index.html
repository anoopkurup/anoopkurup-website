                    <h2>The 6 Most Common Marketing Problems</h2>
                    <p>Most businesses don&#39;t fail at marketing because they lack effort. They fail because of these systematic issues:</p>
                </div>

                                <h3>Scattered &amp; Generic Messaging</h3>
                                <p>Prospects can&rsquo;t quickly understand what makes you different from competitors, leading to longer sales cycles and price-based competition.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Tactics Without Strategy</h3>
                                <p>Teams post on LinkedIn, run ads, and create content without a unified plan that connects these activities to business goals.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Over-Reliance on Referrals</h3>
                                <p>Growth becomes unpredictable and vulnerable to market changes, economic downturns, or key relationship dependencies.</p>

                                <h3>Disconnected Tool Experiments</h3>
                                <p>AI and new tools are added without integration into systematic workflows, creating more complexity instead of efficiency.</p>

                                <h3>Weak Follow-Up Systems</h3>
                                <p>Qualified prospects who aren&rsquo;t ready to buy immediately are lost, while competitors capture these opportunities.</p>

                                <p>Sporadic posting and content creation means prospects forget about you between interactions, while competitors who show up consistently capture mindshare and opportunities.</p>

                                <p>Marketing agencies, law firms, consulting practices, training companies, and specialized B2B services firms with 10-50 employees. These are businesses built on expertise and relationships, but they&rsquo;ve hit the ceiling of what referrals alone can deliver.
